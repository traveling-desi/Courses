/**
 * @class ThreadPoolDownloadService
 *
 * @brief This Service handles downloading several files concurrently
 *        within a pool of Threads.  When it is created, it creates a
 *        ThreadPoolExecutor using the newFixedThreadPool() method of
 *        the Executors class.
 * 
 *        When this Service is started, it should be supplied with a
 *        URI for download and a Messenger.  It downloads the URI
 *        supplied, stores it on the Android file system, then returns
 *        the pathname of the downloaded file using the supplied
 *        Messenger.
 * 
 *        This class implements the Synchronous Service layer of the
 *        Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern.  It also implements a variant
 *        of the Factory Method pattern.
