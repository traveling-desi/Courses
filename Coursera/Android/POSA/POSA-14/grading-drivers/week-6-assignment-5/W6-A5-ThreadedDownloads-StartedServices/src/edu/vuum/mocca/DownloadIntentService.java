/**
 * @class DownloadIntentService
 *
 * @brief This class extends the IntentService, which provides a
 *        framework that simplifies programming and processing Android
 *        Started Services concurrently.
 * 
 *        DownloadIntentService receives an Intent containing a URL
 *        (which is a type of URI) and a Messenger (which is an IPC
 *        mechanism). It downloads the file at the URL, stores it on
 *        the file system, then returns the path name to the caller
 *        using the supplied Messenger.
 * 
 *        The IntentService class implements the CommandProcessor
 *        pattern and the Template Method Pattern.  The Messenger is
 *        used as part of the Active Object pattern.

     * Pattern. The Template class has an overall design goal and

     * the creation and lifecycle of a started service, but allows a
