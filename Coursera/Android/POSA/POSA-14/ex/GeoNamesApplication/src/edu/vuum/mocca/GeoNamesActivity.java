/**
 * This is the main activity that the program uses to start the
 * GeoNamesApplication, which provides access to the GeoNames
 * geographical database via its RESTful Web services API, as
 * described at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoNames.  It allows the
 * user to input a URL containing a request for one of its various
 * services, such as direct and reverse geocoding, finding places
 * through postal codes, finding places next to a given place, and
 * finding Wikipedia articles about neighbouring places.
 *
 * The GeoNamesActivity uses Bound Services to perform the actual
 * interactions with the GeoNames Web services in background Threads
 * running in a separate process.  There are two types of Bound
 * Services shown in this example: synchronous and asynchronous.  The
 * Activity starts the desired Service using bindService().  After the
 * Service is started, its onBind() hook method returns an
 * implementation of an AIDL interface to the Activity by
 * asynchronously calling the onServiceConnected() hook method in the
 * Activity.  The AIDL interface object that's returned can then be
 * used to interact with the Service either synchronously or
 * asynchronously, depending on the type of AIDL interface requested.
 * 
 * Starting Bound Services to run synchronously in background Threads
 * from the asynchronous UI Thread is an example of the
 * Half-Sync/Half-Async Pattern.  Starting Bound Services using
 * Intents is an example of the Activator and Command Processor
 * patterns.  The GeoNamesActivity plays the role of the Creator and
 * creates a Command in the form of an Intent.  The Intent is received
 * by the service process, which plays the role of the Executor.
 * 
 * The use of AIDL interfaces to pass information between two
 * different processes is an example of the Broker Pattern, in which
 * all communication-related functionality is encapsulated in the AIDL
 * interface and the underlying Android Binder framework, shielding
 * applications from tedious and error-prone aspects of inter-process
 * communication.
